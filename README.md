#### Lets solve some code challenges! These challenges are designed specifically to have solutions that involve 

### **_HASH TABLES_**.

Don't worry if it isn't immediately clear how to solve them, work through different ideas and write some code! It's okay to work through a 'naive' solve first and then move on to applying a hash table to optimize your solution.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repo, and cd into python-hash-table-challenges
* each challenge is in a `.py` file so you can work on them one at time and use the command `python <filename>.py` to check your work
* the challenges are ranked from least to most challenging, so start with number one
